					<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
					<p>
						For my final project, I created a program that shows a full breakdown of what a small,
						modern web application design process would look like. What I built, is a program that
						lets the user visualize a guitar fretboard with various scales displayed on it. It’s
						designed to be extensible so if I ever want to improve on it I can. The project’s scope
						isn’t huge but, it showcases many aspects of the web development stack. It’s using a
						modern workflow with React, Vite, Node.js, MongoDB, CSS styles, and more.
					</p>
					<p>
						In terms of software engineering, it “looks like” an MVC(Model-View-Controller) app but
						it’s React so its slightly different. The goal is to separate the decision making from
						the user interface for a modular design (I might be able to reuse the UI elsewhere for
						example). The model portion contains the programs logic concerning the notes, scales and
						algorithms while the view portion handles the UI. React hooks are how the transitions
						are managed.
					</p>
					<p>
						The program uses some simple algorithms to organize the scales and then lay them out
						correctly on the fretboard. There are twelve notes in the chromatic scale, so they are
						represented with an array. Then the scales can be represented as a list of semitone
						intervals from the root of the scale. When the user pics a root note and scale type, the
						app finds the index of the root note in the NOTES array, and for each interval performs
						a calculation to get the index and then uses that on the NOTES array (NOTES[index]) and
						collects them all into a set.
					</p>
					<p>
						Time complexity is constant. Theres a fixed number of notes in a scale. So if k is the
						number of notes, finding the rootIndex with a scan over 12 notes would be O(12) or O(1),
						looping over it is O(k) and storing it is O(k) as well. Since this is the case, in Big-O
						notation it would be O(k).
					</p>
					<p>
						To display the notes on the fretboard, I represent the guitar strings as an array,
						decide how many frets to show, and then for each string, start with the open string’s
						note index, add the fret number to find the note and use modulo 12 to make sure it stays
						in the acceptable boundary. Time complexity for this is O(S * F). S = number of strings,
						F = frets, k = notes. There’s an outer and inner loop which adds time but, this is
						always going to be a small group of numbers.
					</p>
					<p>
						The database is simple and straightforward. It makes sure the page has a “state” that
						doesn’t go away when the page is refreshed. There are a lot of things in this program
						that could eventually make use of a database, but it would add a lot of complexity, and
						I’d like to keep this more focused. Examples would be, lots of complex chords and scales
						and user profiles.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project showcases a full range of abilities that can be expanded on in the future
						to take me different directions. I’m also a guitar player so this was an interesting
						project to work on and one that I can use and expand on. If this were the real world,
						there might be other team members, some on database, some working on UI, some talking to
						stakeholders. I would spend a lot of time on security and algorithm efficiency.
					</p>
					<p>
						I only did this project instead of a few small ones to illustrate different strengths. I
						made a prototype and then made changes to it throughout the course. I’d also like to add
						that in this class and throughout, I got a lot of experience with project management and
						things like GitHub. And GitHub pages.
